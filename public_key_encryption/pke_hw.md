#Why is PKE used over general encrypion?

PKE is more secure than symmetric encryptions. It uses a private key that stays secret since it can be stored  on an isolated computer with no network connections. As a result, it can not be intercepted by the hackers. Additionally, it is very hard to come up with factors of a huge size of  semi-prime numbers (2048 bit RSA Keys is recommended standard since 2015)


#How do you think we can protect our encrypted data and take into account computer speeds?

It is crucial to set up the two-factor authorization to protect our account. Additionally, We can activate the i-cloud advanced data protection. In this case, most of our iCloud data will be protected by end-to-end encryption, where data is not stored on the server nor transmitted. Also, in a broader aspect, setting up a system that combines symmetric and asymmetric cryptographic protocol would provide protection and reasonable speed.
