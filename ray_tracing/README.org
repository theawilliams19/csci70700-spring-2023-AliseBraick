Q#1: How did changing the spectral quality of an object effect the output?

The output can differ in the proportion of the incident light that falls on the object and the reflected lioght as well. The dark objects reflect less than the light ones.

Q#2: How did changing the size of the output affect the rendering time?

The rendering time increase as you increase the size of the sphere
